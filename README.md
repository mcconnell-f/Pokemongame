Graphics for the Pokemon game- 
Most of the code is not mine (it is from Kims code which I used as a template)
I had a hard time working with pygame, so I mostly used his screen code with some of my base code. I also made a few minor changes to aqquaint myself with the program (color of highlights, images, default pokemon list, etc.). I figured it was better to learn about the program by mimicking another code than to not use it at all just because I was having a hard time figuring it out.
The code can be run using python main.py
